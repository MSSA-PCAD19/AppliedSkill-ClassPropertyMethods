The development team needs your help to modify C# code for three of our ongoing development projects.

We have some general guidelines that you must follow when you perform your tasks. Please always use the following guidelines:

When creating objects, use the default settings unless a different configuration is required to complete the task successfully.

Only create, delete, or modify objects to achieve the stated requirements. Unnecessary changes to the environment can adversely affect your final score.

If there are multiple approaches to achieving a goal, always choose the approach that requires the least amount of administrative effort.

Thanks,

Chief Technology Officer (CTO)

Hello,

We are developing a banking app for a customer.

The project is named Banking.csproj and is located on your computer at C:\Projects\Task1.

The Banking project has the following code files:

BankAccount.cs

Program.cs

This is your task:

In the BankAccount.cs file, you need to configure the following:

Create a new public class named BankAccount in a namespace called Banking.

Create two properties named AccountNumber and Balance. The AccountNumber property must store strings in the format of "123-456". The Balance property must be of type decimal.

The following TODO comment has been added to the code to indicate where your changes should be made:

TODO Task 1.1
In the Program.cs file, you need to configure the following:

Create an instance of the BankAccount class and populate the class with a sample account number and balance. For example, AccountNumber with the value "123-456" and Balance with the value $1000.23.

Assign the instance to a variable named account.

The following TODO comment has been added to the code to indicate where your changes should be made:

TODO Task 1.2
Note: Only modify the code referenced between the comments and leave all comment lines intact.

The code must compile with the existing code in Program.cs to display an output as shown in the following example:

Account 123-456 Balance: $1,000.23

Thanks,

************** Task 2 *************************************
Hello,

We are developing a student attendance app and need to modify the app code to address additional customer requirements.

The project is named StudentAttendance.csproj and is located on your computer at C:\Projects\Task2.

This is your task:

You need to modify the Program.cs file to meet the following requirements:

Ensure that the FirstName, MiddleName, and LastName properties can only be modified within the Student class.

Since some students may not have a middle name, ensure that the MiddleName property of the Student class allows null values.

In the Student class, create an additional constructor method that accepts only FirstName and LastName.

In the Main function of the Program class, create an instance of the Student class that has sample FirstName of Ben, MiddleName of Sam, and LastName of Smith.

The following TODO comments have been added to the code to indicate where your changes should be made:

TODO Task 2.1
TODO Task 2.2
TODO Task 2.3
TODO Task 2.4
Note: Only modify the code referenced between the comments and leave all comment lines intact.

Thanks,
